      <h2 class="siteHeader-subtitle">About Me</h2>
      <p class="siteHeader-text">
        Welcome to my world of innovation! I'm Maiteth Jones, and I have worn many
        hats throughout my career. In the past, I worked as a financial analyst,
        crunching numbers and navigating the world of investments. But there was
        always another passion simmering beneath the surface - web design.

      <p class="siteHeader-text">
        During my days as a financial analyst, web design was more than just a
        hobby; it was a creative outlet that allowed me to explore new ideas and
        push the boundaries of my own skills. However, life's beautiful chaos
        took over as I started a family, and my web design dreams were
        temporarily put on hold.

      <p class="siteHeader-text">
        Now, with my children a bit more independent and free time on my side,
        I have decided to take the plunge into the exciting world of front-end
        development. I'm embarking on a journey to retrain and explore the
        limitless possibilities of web innovation.
